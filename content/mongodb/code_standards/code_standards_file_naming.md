- Separate words with hyphens (i.e. -.).

- File names should have a terse one or two word name that describes the material covered in the document. Allow the path of the file within the document tree to add some of the required context/categorization. For example itâ€™s acceptable to have /core/sharding.rst and /administration/sharding.rst.

```
