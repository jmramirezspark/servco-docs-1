### 2 Spaces for indentation

Use 2 spaces for indenting your code and swear an oath to never mix tabs and
spaces - a special kind of hell is awaiting you otherwise.

### Newlines

Use UNIX-style newlines (`\n`), and a newline character as the last character
of a file. Windows-style newlines (`\r\n`) are forbidden inside any repository.

### No trailing whitespace

Just like you brush your teeth after every meal, you clean up any trailing
whitespace in your JS files before committing. Otherwise the rotten smell of
careless neglect will eventually drive away contributors and/or co-workers.

### Use Semicolons

According to [scientific research][hnsemicolons], the usage of semicolons is
a core value of our community. Consider the points of [the opposition][], but
be a traditionalist when it comes to abusing error correction mechanisms for
cheap syntactic pleasures.

### 80 characters per line

Limit your lines to 80 characters. Yes, screens have gotten much bigger over the
last few years, but your brain has not. Use the additional room for split screen,
your editor supports that, right?

### Use single quotes

Use single quotes, unless you are writing JSON.

*Right:*

```js
var foo = 'bar';
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var foo = "bar";
```

### Opening braces go on the same line

Your opening braces go on the same line as the statement.

*Right:*

```js
if (true) {
  console.log('winning');
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
if (true)
{
  console.log('losing');
}
```

Also, notice the use of whitespace before and after the condition statement.

### Declare one variable per var statement

Declare one variable per var statement, it makes it easier to re-order the
lines. However, ignore [Crockford][crockfordconvention] when it comes to
declaring variables deeper inside a function, just put the declarations wherever
they make sense.

*Right:*

```js
var keys   = ['foo', 'bar'];
var values = [23, 42];

var object = {};
while (keys.length) {
  var key = keys.pop();
  object[key] = values.pop();
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var keys = ['foo', 'bar'],
    values = [23, 42],
    object = {},
    key;

while (keys.length) {
  key = keys.pop();
  object[key] = values.pop();
}
```
