### Object.freeze, Object.preventExtensions, Object.seal, with, eval

Crazy shit that you will probably never need. Stay away from it.

### Requires At Top

Always put requires at top of file to clearly illustrate a file's dependencies. Besides giving an overview for others at a quick glance of dependencies and possible memory impact, it allows one to determine if they need a package.json file should they choose to use the file elsewhere.

### Getters and setters

Do not use setters, they cause more problems for people who try to use your
software than they can solve.

Feel free to use getters that are free from [side effects][sideeffect], like
providing a length property for a collection class.

[sideeffect]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)

### Do not extend built-in prototypes

Do not extend the prototype of native JavaScript objects. Your future self will
be forever grateful.

*Right:*

```js
var a = [];
if (!a.length) {
  console.log('winning');
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
Array.prototype.empty = function() {
  return !this.length;
}

var a = [];
if (a.empty()) {
  console.log('losing');
}
```
